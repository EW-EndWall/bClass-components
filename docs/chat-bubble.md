      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
      readable English.
    </p>
  </span>
  <div class="text-r">
    <span class="border-r-0-1 p-r-0-7 text-r">01.01.2000</span>
    <span class="p-x-0-5">21:38</span>
    <span>
      <!-- not sent -->
